# SpecKit Tooling Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-First Development

Every feature begins with a complete specification before any implementation. Specifications MUST define user scenarios, requirements, and success criteria in technology-agnostic language. No code SHALL be written until the specification is approved by a human stakeholder.

**Rationale**: Prevents scope creep, ensures shared understanding, and enables independent testing of requirements before technical decisions are made.

### II. Human Gate Protocol

All specification artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) MUST be presented to the user for explicit approval before persistence. The system SHALL offer [approve], [expand], [edit], [reject] options and MUST NOT assume implicit approval.

**Rationale**: Maintains human authority over project direction, prevents automated decisions from diverging from stakeholder intent, and ensures artifacts align with actual needs.

### III. Test-Driven Implementation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

When tests are specified in the feature requirements, they MUST be written FIRST and MUST FAIL before implementation begins. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced: failing tests → implementation → passing tests → refactoring.

**Rationale**: Ensures code meets requirements, prevents regression, and validates that tests are actually testing the intended behavior rather than existing implementation.

**Enforcement**: Tasks involving tests SHALL include explicit checkpoints: "Verify test fails" BEFORE "Implement feature".

### IV. Progressive Documentation

Documentation follows Just-In-Time (JIT) loading principles:
- **plan.md**: Core technical context and structure (<200 lines preferred)
- **research.md**: Detailed research and alternatives (Phase 0 output)
- **data-model.md**: Entity and schema details (Phase 1 output)
- **contracts/**: API contracts and interface definitions (Phase 1 output)
- **tasks.md**: Granular implementation tasks (Phase 2 output, generated by separate command)

Core documents MUST reference detailed documents rather than inlining extensive content.

**Rationale**: Reduces cognitive load, enables targeted reading, and keeps core planning documents scannable and maintainable.

### V. Constitution Compliance

All generated artifacts MUST pass Constitution Check before Phase 0 research and MUST be re-checked after Phase 1 design. Violations MUST be documented in the "Complexity Tracking" section with explicit justification and rejected simpler alternatives.

**Rationale**: Prevents architectural drift, enforces conscious decisions about complexity, and ensures governance rules are actively validated rather than passively assumed.

## Development Workflow

### Phase 0: Research (plan command)
- Load feature specification from user
- Generate plan.md with technical context
- Generate research.md with alternatives and trade-offs
- Present for Human Gate approval

### Phase 1: Design (plan command)
- Generate data-model.md with entities and schemas
- Generate quickstart.md with setup and usage instructions
- Generate contracts/ with API/interface definitions
- Re-run Constitution Check
- Present for Human Gate approval

### Phase 2: Task Breakdown (tasks command)
- Load approved plan.md, spec.md, and Phase 1 artifacts
- Generate tasks.md organized by user story priority
- Group tasks by story for independent implementation
- Mark parallel opportunities with [P]
- Present for Human Gate approval

### Phase 3: Implementation (manual or automated)
- Execute tasks following priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- Follow Test-Driven Implementation principle when tests are specified
- Commit after each logical task or group
- Validate checkpoints at story completion

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Research Gate (Before Phase 0)
- [ ] Feature specification exists and is approved
- [ ] User scenarios are defined with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Constitution Check passes or violations are justified

### Pre-Design Gate (Before Phase 1)
- [ ] Research document approved
- [ ] Technical approach selected and justified
- [ ] Dependencies and constraints identified

### Pre-Implementation Gate (Before Phase 2)
- [ ] All design documents approved (data-model, quickstart, contracts)
- [ ] Constitution Check re-validated
- [ ] Project structure defined
- [ ] Test strategy determined (if applicable)

### Per-Story Gate (During Phase 3)
- [ ] Story tests written and failing (if tests are specified)
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Story tests passing (if tests are specified)
- [ ] Story independently testable
- [ ] Story documented

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

1. **Proposal**: Document proposed change with rationale and impact analysis
2. **Review**: Assess compatibility with existing artifacts and workflows
3. **Approval**: Explicit human approval required
4. **Migration**: Update all templates and documentation referencing changed principles
5. **Version**: Increment version according to semantic versioning

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible changes to principles or workflow phases
- **MINOR**: New principles added or existing principles materially expanded
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

All artifacts generated by /speckit commands MUST verify compliance with this constitution. Violations MUST be reported to the user with the specific principle violated and SHALL NOT be persisted without explicit override approval.

### Runtime Guidance

For general development practices and coding standards outside the /speckit workflow, refer to the project-level `CONSTITUTION.md` at the repository root. For Hefesto-specific skill generation rules, refer to `.context/standards/architectural-rules.md`.
