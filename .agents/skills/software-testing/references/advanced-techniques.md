# Expert Techniques

## Specialist Playbook

- Build architecture fitness checks for constraints in: test pyramid, contract testing, deterministic fixtures, and CI quality gates.
- Track leading indicators: latency budget drift, retry amplification, and dependency saturation.
- Run canary validations before broad rollout for high-risk changes.
- Convert incident findings into deterministic tests and operational runbooks.

## Advanced Governance

- Use ADRs tied to measurable outcomes, not only descriptive documentation.
- Maintain a risk register for critical dependencies and upgrade paths.
- Review architectural debt periodically with business impact context.
- Keep quality gates stable across local, CI, and production release flows.
