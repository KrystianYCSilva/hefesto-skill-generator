# Version History and Usage Divergences

## Evolution Notes

- Domain: test pyramid, contract testing, deterministic fixtures, and CI quality gates.
- Common divergence areas: unit tests, integration tests, contract tests, test data.
- Teams with explicit governance and compatibility tests tend to scale safer.
- Teams without rollout discipline usually see integration regressions and unstable operations.

## Upgrade and Migration Checklist

- Validate dependencies and runtime compatibility in staging.
- Execute contract and integration test suites before release.
- Keep rollback artifacts, migration notes, and abort criteria available.
- Capture observed divergences and feed them into architecture runbooks.
