# Java and Kotlin Usage Examples

## Java Example

`java
log.info("order_created orderId={} customerId={}", orderId, customerId);
`

## Kotlin Example

`kotlin
logger.info("order_created orderId={} customerId={}", orderId, customerId)
`

## Practical Language Tips

- Keep API and event contracts typed and versioned.
- Align nullability, enums, and date/time serialization across Java and Kotlin.
- Use shared contract tests to prevent cross-language regressions.
- Prefer immutable transport models for integration boundaries.
