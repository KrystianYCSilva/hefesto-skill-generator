# Design Principles

## SOLID
-   **S**ingle Responsibility: A class should have one reason to change.
-   **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification.
-   **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types.
-   **I**nterface Segregation: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
-   **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

## General
-   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous representation.
-   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Most systems work best if they are kept simple.
-   **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.
