# Expert Techniques

- Index sessions by principal for immediate forced logout and incident response.
- Encrypt or minimize sensitive attributes stored in session payloads.
- Keep session payload schema versioned for rolling deployments.
- Add session churn dashboards (create, invalidate, expire) to detect auth anomalies.

## Specialist Playbook

- Define measurable SLOs per critical path and map each technique to a target metric.
- Keep rollback strategies documented before applying high-risk optimizations.
- Run game days to validate failure-path assumptions under realistic load.
- Standardize diagnostics (logs, metrics, traces) before deep tuning.
