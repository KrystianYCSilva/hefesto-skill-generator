# Version History and Usage Divergences

| Version Line | Key Change | Practical Divergence |
|---|---|---|
| Spring Cache baseline | Provider abstraction remained stable | Teams often overfit to provider-specific semantics anyway |
| Boot 3 era | Jakarta ecosystem and modern observability integration | Cache metrics and tracing became easier but required disciplined tagging |

## Deep Divergence Notes

- Major version transitions usually combine runtime baseline upgrades and compatibility breaks.
- Validate transitive dependencies and integration points before promoting framework upgrades.
- Maintain migration checklists with rollback criteria and contract verification.
