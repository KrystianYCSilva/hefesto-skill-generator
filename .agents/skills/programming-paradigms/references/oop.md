# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Pillars
1.  **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods. restricting direct access (`private`).
2.  **Inheritance**: Deriving new classes from existing ones. *Warning*: Prefer Composition over Inheritance.
3.  **Polymorphism**: Objects of different types treated as instances of a common superclass.
4.  **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details.

## SOLID Principles
-   **S**ingle Responsibility
-   **O**pen/Closed
-   **L**iskov Substitution
-   **I**nterface Segregation
-   **D**ependency Inversion

## Patterns
-   **Design Patterns**: Factory, Singleton, Strategy, Observer.
