# Expert Techniques

- Use cell-based architecture to limit blast radius for multi-tenant systems.
- Track coupling by change-frequency and runtime dependency, not only diagrams.
- Measure cognitive load per team as a decomposition fitness function.
- Implement strangler migrations with measurable cutover checkpoints.

## Specialist Playbook

- Apply fitness functions for coupling, latency budget, and team cognitive load.
- Use asynchronous boundaries only where ownership and replay strategy are explicit.
- Define dependency SLO contracts between producer and consumer teams.
- Keep architecture decision records linked to measured outcomes.
