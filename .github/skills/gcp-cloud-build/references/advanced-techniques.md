# Expert Techniques

## Specialist Playbook

- Define architecture fitness checks for key constraints in this domain: Build stages, security controls, cache strategy, and progressive delivery.
- Create synthetic checks for high-risk flows and track regression trends over releases.
- Use staged rollout (canary then progressive traffic shift) tied to SLO gates.
- Build incident playbooks from real outages and validate them in game days.

## Advanced Governance Practices

- Keep Architecture Decision Records (ADR) linked to measurable outcomes.
- Track coupling, latency budget, and deployment lead time as health indicators.
- Maintain a dependency risk register for critical external integrations.
- Revisit operational thresholds after each significant scale or topology change.
