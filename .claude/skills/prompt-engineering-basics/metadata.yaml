example_prompt: |
  "I need to improve my AI prompts for content generation - show me best practices"
  "How do I use few-shot prompting for data extraction tasks?"
  "What's the difference between zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting?"
  "How can I use self-criticism to improve AI outputs?"
  "When should I use decomposition vs ensembling techniques?"
test_cases:
  - input: "Write a prompt to extract structured data from unstructured text"
    expected_output: "Few-shot prompt with 2-3 examples showing input-output format, explicit JSON structure specification"
  - input: "How do I get better reasoning from AI on math problems?"
    expected_output: "Chain-of-thought technique with 'Let's think step by step' trigger, example demonstrating step-by-step breakdown"
  - input: "AI keeps giving generic responses to my questions"
    expected_output: "Role prompting suggestion, adding specific constraints, using context, or providing examples"
  - input: "How can I verify the accuracy of AI responses?"
    expected_output: "Ensembling technique with multiple reasoning paths, self-criticism for error detection, or decomposition for validation"
  - input: "I need to solve a complex system design problem with AI"
    expected_output: "Decomposition approach breaking problem into sub-components, possibly combined with thought generation for exploring alternatives"

compatibility: |
  Universal skill applicable to all text-based AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cohere, etc.).
  No special tools or API access required. Works through web interfaces, APIs, and embedded AI features.
  Techniques are model-agnostic but effectiveness may vary based on model capabilities.
  Advanced techniques (ensembling, thought generation) work best with larger models (>100B parameters).
skill_level: beginner-advanced
estimated_time: "15-20 minutes to learn core techniques, 30+ minutes for advanced techniques, ongoing practice for mastery"
interactive: true
requires_approval: false
security_notes: |
  - Never include sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII) in prompts
  - Be aware prompts may be logged by AI providers
  - Verify AI outputs before using in production or critical decisions
  - Don't rely on AI for medical, legal, or financial advice without expert review
  - Test prompts with non-sensitive data first
  - Be cautious with AI-generated code (review for security vulnerabilities)
  - Ensembling and self-criticism can improve accuracy but still require human verification for critical tasks
performance_considerations: |
  - Longer prompts (especially with many examples) may increase response time and cost
  - Chain-of-thought prompting generates longer outputs (higher token usage)
  - Few-shot prompting requires more input tokens but improves accuracy
  - Some models have context window limits (test with your target model)
  - Prompt complexity affects response time and consistency
  - Advanced techniques (self-criticism, ensembling, thought generation) significantly increase token usage and cost
  - Self-criticism: ~2-3x tokens (generates, critiques, revises)
  - Ensembling: 3-5x tokens (multiple reasoning paths)
  - Thought generation: 3-10x tokens (explores multiple branches)
  - Use advanced techniques strategically for high-value tasks where accuracy justifies cost
