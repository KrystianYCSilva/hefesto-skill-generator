# Architectural & Design Patterns

## Gang of Four (GoF)
-   **Singleton**: One instance. (Use sparingly).
-   **Factory**: Creates objects without specifying exact class.
-   **Observer**: Publish/Subscribe mechanism.
-   **Strategy**: Interchangeable algorithms.
-   **Decorator**: Add behavior dynamically.

## Architectural Patterns
-   **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separates data, UI, and logic. Web apps.
-   **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Two-way binding. Modern UI frameworks (React, Vue, Android).
-   **Microservices**: Small, independent services communicating via API.
-   **Event-Driven**: Components react to events. Decoupled and asynchronous.

## SOLID Principles
1.  **S**: Single Responsibility (One reason to change).
2.  **O**: Open/Closed (Open for extension, closed for modification).
3.  **L**: Liskov Substitution (Subtypes must be substitutable for base types).
4.  **I**: Interface Segregation (Client shouldn't depend on methods it doesn't use).
5.  **D**: Dependency Inversion (Depend on abstractions, not concretions).
