# Version History and Usage Divergences

## Baseline Evolution

- This domain evolved with stronger emphasis on contract-first delivery and controlled rollout strategy.
- Tooling maturity increased observability and automation, but also increased governance requirements.
- Teams commonly diverge in usage due differences in boundary discipline and ownership models.

## Domain-Specific Divergence Notes

- Scope: Layer responsibilities, dependency direction, module boundaries, and architecture fitness checks.
- Frequent divergence points: controller-service-repository, dependency rules, module boundaries.
- Migration caution: validate transitive dependencies and runtime compatibility before production upgrades.

## Upgrade Checklist

- Validate compatibility in staging with production-like data and traffic profile.
- Run contract tests and integration tests for all critical boundaries.
- Keep rollback artifacts and clear abort criteria ready.
- Document behavior differences and update operational runbooks.
