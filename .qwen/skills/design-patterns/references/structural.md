# Structural Patterns

## Adapter
Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
-   *Use when*: You want to use an existing class, but its interface doesn't match the one you need.

## Decorator
Adds new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects.
-   *Use when*: You need to add behaviors at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects.

## Facade
Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
-   *Use when*: You need to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.

## Composite
Composes objects into tree structures and then works with these structures as if they were individual objects.
-   *Use when*: You need to implement a tree-like object structure (e.g., File System).
